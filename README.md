📌 Problem Statement
Large and mid-scale companies depend on expensive human consultants for business strategy, HR planning, and operational optimization.
These consulting services are:
Costly
Time-consuming
Not scalable for startups and SMEs
There is a strong need for an automated, intelligent, and scalable consulting solution that can analyze business data and provide actionable decisions without human dependency.
💡 Proposed Solution
AI Consultant-as-a-Service (AICaaS) is an AI-powered prototype that replaces traditional consulting roles by:
Analyzing structured business data
Detecting performance issues
Generating strategic, HR, and operational recommendations automatically
This system acts as a virtual consultant for organizations.
